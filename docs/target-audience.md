# Target audience of the SiloGen platform

The SiloGen platform and this documentation is designed for three user personas, each focusing on different layer and aspects of the AI technology stack and lifecycle.

- **Infrastructure administrators:** Professionals responsible for setting up, maintaining, and optimizing the infrastructure that supports AI workloads.
- **AI resource managers:** Professionals responsible for granting access to compute resources, maintaining projects, users and quotas, and optimizing AI resources.

- **AI practitioners:** Professionals who train, deploy and manage AI models and applications in an enterprise environment.

While some familiarity with Kubernetes, containerization, and AI/ML concepts is helpful, this handbook provides detailed instructions and explanations to accommodate users with varying levels of expertise. The handbook guides you to set up a fully deployed SiloGen Enterprise AI platform optimized for AI workloads on AMD compute. The handbook also provides the knowledge needed to run and manage AI use cases effectively.
