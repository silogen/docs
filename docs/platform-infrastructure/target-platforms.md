# Target platforms

The following infrastructure platforms are supported:

- **On-premises environment:** This includes setting up a one-node demo cluster with built-in storage and secrets management. The main use case is to quickly get started running AI workloads on the SiloGen platform. See the installation article [here](./demo-environment.md).
- **Azure cloud with AKS:** See instructions on how to set up a virtual machine with Instinct MI300X and the SiloGen platform on Azure cloud [here](https://instinct.docs.amd.com/projects/instinct-azure/latest/mi300x.html)
