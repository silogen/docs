# Tutorials

These tutorials are step-by-step guides with practical examples on how to run AI model training, fine-tuning, and inference workloads using the SiloGen platform.

- [Tutorial 0: Prerequisites for running the tutorials](./ai-workloads-docs/tutorials/tutorial-prereqs.md): Shared setup needed for the tutorials, including platform configurations such as secrets and storage.
- [Deliver resources and fine-tune](./ai-workloads-docs/tutorials/tutorial-01-deliver-resources-and-finetune.md): Learn how to download models and data to cluster MinIO storage, run fine-tuning jobs, and deploy inference services.
- [Language extension: Odia fine-tuning](./ai-workloads-docs/tutorials/tutorial-02-language-extension-finetune.md): Learn how to fine-tune a continued pretraining base model to make it an instruction-following model, then deploy models and compare results.
