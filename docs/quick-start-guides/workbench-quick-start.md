# Quick start guide for AI practitioners

The SiloGen platform provides a stable starting point for AI model development, fine-tuning, and inference with the help of an easy-to-use model catalog and AI developer workspaces. To work efficiently in the SiloGen platform, an AI developer should have some experience with AI terminology and a general understanding of typical AI development workflows.

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes the user has access to an installed SiloGen platform. Besides that, you should have access to compute cluster and a project with allocated compute resources.

**Your system needs a Hugging Face token to download models.**

## Getting started

1. Activate your SiloGen account and login to AMD AI Workbench.
2. Complete the model fine-tuning tutorial to get hands-on with the AMD AI Workbench.
3. Browse through the AMD AI Workbench end user documentation in order to familiarize yourself with the AMD AI Workbench features.

### Activate your SiloGen account

1. You should have received a registration email with a link to activate your account. Click on the link in this email to start the registration process.
  - In case you have not received an email, please contact your SiloGen platform admin.
2. Login to AMD AI Workbench through your organization's login URL (ask for the URL from your platform admin).
3. Access the AMD AI Workbench tab on the left panel once you have logged in to the platform.

### Complete a tutorial

Based on your background you can choose either low-code or more advanced coding tutorials.

#### Model deployment and inference

To learn how to deploy a model and run inference, please complete the tutorial ["How to deploy a model and run inference"](../core/docs/workbench/inference/how-to-deploy-and-inference.md).


#### Low-code tutorial: fine-tune a model with low code

To learn how to finetune a model with only little coding experience needed, please complete the tutorial ["Fine-tune a model with low code"](../tutorials/low-code-fine-tuning-tutorial.md).

#### Advanced tutorial: hands-on AI development using AI workspaces

To learn how to develop AI models using workspaces, please complete the tutorial ["AI workspace tutorial"](../tutorials/ai-workspace-tutorial.md).

### Further discovery

Browse through the [SiloGen end-user documentation](https://docs.silogen.ai/core/docs/workbench/overview/) to familiarize yourself with the AMD AI Workbench features.
