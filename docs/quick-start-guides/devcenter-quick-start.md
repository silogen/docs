# Quick start guide for AI practitioners

The SiloGen platform provides a stable starting point for AI model development, fine-tuning, and inference with the help of an easy-to-use model catalog and AI developer workspaces. To work efficiently in the SiloGen platform, an AI developer should have some experience with AI terminology and a general understanding of typical AI development workflows.

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes the user has access to an installed SiloGen platform. Besides that, you should have access to compute cluster and a project with allocated compute resources.

## Getting started

1. Activate your SiloGen account and login to SiloGen Developer Center.
2. Complete the model fine-tuning tutorial to get hands-on with the Developer Center.
3. Read the Developer Center end user documentation in order to familiarize yourself with the SiloGen Developer Center features.

### 1. Activate your SiloGen account & login to SiloGen Developer Center

1. You should have received a registration email with a link to activate your account. Click on the link in this email to start the registration process.
  - In case you have not received an email, please contact your SiloGen platform admin.
2. Login to SiloGen Developer Center through your organization's SiloGen URL (ask for the URL from your SiloGen platform admin).
3. Access the Developer Center tab on the left panel once you have logged in to SiloGen.

### 2. Complete a tutorial

Based on your background. For more adavanced users like data scientists we recommend the `Hands-on AI development using AI workspaces` and in case you want to in no code we recommend the `Fine-tune a model with no code`.

### 2a. No-code tutorial: fine-tune a model with no code

In order to get started with Developer Center no-code features, please follow the instructions in ["Fine-tune a model with no code"](../tutorials/no-code-fine-tuning-tutorial.md).

### 2b. Advanced tutorial: hands-on AI development using AI workspaces

In case you want to be more hands-on and work with code,  please follow the instructions in ["AI workspace tutorial"](../tutorials/ai-workspace-tutorial.md).

## Further discovery

Browse through the [SiloGen end-user documentation](https://docs.silogen.ai/core/docs/developer-center/overview/) to familiarize yourself with the SiloGen Developer Center features.
