# Quick start guide for AI practitioners

The SiloGen platform provides a stable starting point for AI model development, fine-tuning, and inference with the help of an easy-to-use model catalog and AI developer workspaces. To work efficiently in the SiloGen platform, an AI developer should have some experience with AI terminology and a general understanding of typical AI development workflows.

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes the user has access to an installed SiloGen platform. Besides that, you should have access to compute cluster and a project with allocated compute resources.

**Your system needs a Hugging Face token to download models.**

## Getting started

1. Activate your SiloGen account and login to SiloGen Developer Center.
2. Complete the model fine-tuning tutorial to get hands-on with the Developer Center.
3. Browse through the Developer Center end user documentation in order to familiarize yourself with the SiloGen Developer Center features.

### Activate your SiloGen account

1. You should have received a registration email with a link to activate your account. Click on the link in this email to start the registration process.
  - In case you have not received an email, please contact your SiloGen platform admin.
2. Login to SiloGen Developer Center through your organization's SiloGen URL (ask for the URL from your SiloGen platform admin).
3. Access the Developer Center tab on the left panel once you have logged in to SiloGen.

### Complete a tutorial
