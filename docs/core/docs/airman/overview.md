# AI Resource Manager overview

The SiloGen platform provides administrators with tools to oversee and control the platformâ€™s computational resources and user access. These features are managed through a module called Airman, short for AI Resource Manager. Its key capabilities include cluster management, monitoring, and maintaining teams' access to computational resources.

## Airman features

Airman is built around the basic usage pattern of maintaining compute resources, setting up teams and projects, and allowing individual users to utilize the resources for their compute needs.

- **Cluster:** The physical part of the platform installation, which can be managed in the Airman user interface.
- **Organization:** An organization is built from teams. Each team can have multiple users and multiple projects.
- **Projects:** A project contains users and a quota for their workloads. Multiple users can belong to multiple projects.
- **Quota:** A quota is a usage limit reserved for a team to accomplish their tasks. Quotas are useful for ensuring everyone gets their fair share of compute resources.
- **User:** Users are individuals who require compute access for work purposes.
