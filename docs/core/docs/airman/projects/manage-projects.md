# Manage projects

A project is a container for managing work. It has a specified compute quota, which is used to limit resources. Users can initiate workloads only in the projects they are assigned to. Only platform administrators can create new projects and assign users to them.

The main projects view lists available projects, the number of assigned users, and a short description of each project. To add a new project, click the "Create project" button.

The project-specific quota is currently set in the Quotas section of Airman.

Clicking a project's name opens the edit view. This view has a form for editing project details. The project's name is permanent and cannot be changed. Click the "Save changes" button to apply updates.

Below the form is an area called "Danger zone". It contains a button for deleting the project. Deleting a project is a permanent action and should not be done without proper consideration.

The right pane lists users assigned to the project and provides an option to add new project members. Administrators can also invite new users directly to the project.
