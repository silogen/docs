# Workloads

A workload is a batch job or a service running in the cluster with resources defined by the workload and limited by the quota that the workload owner has. This page shows all started workloads. The view shows all workload statuses by default except `Deleted`.

If a user belongs to multiple projects, the project needs to be selected first from the top of the page.

The paginated table shows the name of the workload, the cluster the workload is assigned to, and how many resources the workload requires. The `Status` column shows the last known status of the workload and is not updated automatically. Filters can be used to find workloads by name, type, or status.
