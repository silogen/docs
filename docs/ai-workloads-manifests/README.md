# Workloads

This directory contains all the workloads. Each workload has its own directory, with different formats defined in subdirectories.

To create a new workload, you can duplicate an existing workload and adapt as needed.

The files needed to create different instantiations of a workload depends on the format. For reference, see the existing workloads, and the documentation of the respective formats.

For an introduction to AI workloads see the [Workloads overview](./workloads-overview.md)
