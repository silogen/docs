description: How we test our code.

This section contains information about testing our code.

## Unit tests

Check the root directory of each component for instructions. For Python we usually use `pytest` and for JavaScript we use `vitest`.

## Integration tests/End-to-end tests

There is a README in the `silogen/core/testing` directory that explains how to create and run the Robot framework tests. There is a [video recording](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10CEK_R2jJC_jUuwA51KWZHDg1O06Nr7M/view?usp=sharing) that explains the process in detail.
