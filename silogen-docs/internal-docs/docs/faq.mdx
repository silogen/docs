### Is `max_model_len` a flag we can set, or do we just use the vllm default?

    You can set it in server flags as `max-model-len` to edit the model and then edit the pipeline to use the new model version like `llm: edited_model_id`. If you haven't marked your model / pipeline ready, it doesn't even create an new version of it. In that case, only modifying the model should be enough.

### I need some usage statistics regarding organization x. How can I get it?

    In `packages/token_usage/README.md` you can find the usage instructions:

    Print total or monthly token usage information for a selected organization. If organization is not specified print token usage information for all the organizations. Results can also be exported to a CSV file with a `--csv` option. Requires a Tailscale connection and uses production cluster by default.

    Usage: `token_usage <total|monthly> <organization> [--csv] [--users] [--dev/--production]`

    See `token_usage --help` for usage details. [[slack thread](https://siloai-internal.slack.com/archives/C061MM9E9A5/p1726674308938869?thread_ts=1726667622.007439&cid=C061MM9E9A5)]

### Which services are available through Tailscale?

    See this section in the [Internal Network](basics/internal-network#tailscale-services) documentation.

### How to update to the latest version of silodev CLI?

    In a terminal from any directory of the core repository, run the following commands:

    ```
    pushd $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
    pip install -e packages/silocore[dev]
    pip install -e packages/silodev[dev]
    popd
    ````

### Debugging errors when deploying models

If you get an error when trying to deploy a model on dev or when trying to call the model through model-service, please have a look at the [debugging tips](debugging-tips) documentation.

### How to deploy your own embedding model

I'm doing some embedding model finetuning experiments and would like to deploy my embedding models for the document collection to evaluate the whole LLM pipeline. Is this easily doable?

Here are the steps (with sample commits and API docs):

- Add the embedding model in gitops so that it is deployed on dev: https://github.com/silogen/silogen-gitops/commit/7a9fee545c5992072c8811de6e6ed0abfeed5cc5 https://github.com/silogen/silogen-gitops/commit/d284b1b44711117c686dd4a99c6955b07b63ea9a
- Change the document collection service to also use this embedding server and deploy document collection: https://github.com/silogen/silogen-gitops/pull/923/commits/7e5bfaf1b8829a67246458787536a3f3d8b80cf5
- Create a collection with the new embedding server: https://document-collection.dev.silogen.ai/docs#/collections/create_collection_v1_collections_post

### Is it possible to use the OpenAI chat completions Python library to include all the below parameters supported in our API?

Yes `extra_body` parameter is your answer: any named parameter that is not an explicit named parameter in the `completions.create()` call can be added in a dict passed in through `extra_body` parameter. [[slack thread](https://siloai-internal.slack.com/archives/C061MM9E9A5/p1718028620650739)]

#### Example

```python
completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=MODEL_ID,
    messages=history_openai_format,
    temperature=TEMPERATURE,
    stream=STREAM,
    extra_headers=AUTHORIZATION_HEADER,
    extra_body=(
        {
            "collection": {
                "collectionId": RAG_COLLECTION_ID,
                "certainty": RAG_CERTAINTY,
                "top_k": RAG_TOP_K,
            },
            "debug": RAG_DEBUG,
        }
        if RAG_COLLECTION_ID
        else None
    ),
)  # type: ignore
```
