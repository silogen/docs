We use LLM systems that are made of an inference model (“backend model” with
model serving engine) and an LLM pipeline (“frontend” that the customer
interacts with). To add a completely new LLM system, add both a new backend
model and a new pipeline. To only configure an LLM system for new customers, add
a new pipeline to an existing backend model.

## Inspecting models and pipelines

Full list of options with `model_catalog --help`

1. `model_catalog search` to show all models/pipelines, `-v` to show all configuration parameters
   `model_catalog list` to show the latest version of each model/pipeline
   `model_catalog show` to show parameters of one model/pipeline
2. `model_catalog search pipeline --deployed` to show all deployed pipelines
   1. Another way to do this is with `curl https://model-service.services.silogen.ai/v1/models`, or with the inference helper script in `core/tooling/ (inference models)`
