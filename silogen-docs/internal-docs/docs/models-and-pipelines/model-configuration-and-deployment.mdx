The model catalog is a fairly new feature, and some tricks and attention are needed from anyone creating and deploying models to ensure that the catalog stays in order. The help docstrings for model_catalog CLI should be up-to-date, and are a good place to start on how to use the CLI.

## Setting up the model catalog CLI

Because the model catalog CLI does not yet have a separate service and API in the cluster, it needs to be set up locally.

Note that each environment (dev, staging, and production) has its own catalog!

```bash
git clone git@github.com:silogen/core.git
pip install -e core/packages/silocore
pip install -e core/packages/silodev
silodev env activate dev  # Replace dev with production if needed to be in the right env before sourcing the connection variables
source core/tooling/catalog-connection.bash
model_catalog --help
```

If you do not have the proper access to use `silodev env activate` (errors regarding permissions when trying to run it), switch environments with `kubectl config use-context production (or dev, staging)`.

Currently you should make sure you have the same model_catalog code version on your local machine as what is running in the cluster environments! This is tricky to set up, you may need to look up the correct version from ArgoCD or elsewhere. If you know the right version, you can checkout that version of the code by running:

```bash
git checkout VERSION_HASH  # e.g. git checkout 23fc2c60
```
