# Authentication and Authorization

Every employee gets a Google Workspace account that enables “Login with Google” access to many of our internal
systems. You can read about the on-boarding process to find out about them.

Developers can join the SiloGen organization on GitHub, giving them read and write access to our repositories.
If you are going to develop any of our products and services you are going to need such an account. It also
gives you direct access to many of the resources listed below. For some developers, however,
an account with Bitbucket may suffice, and this is provided as part of the on-boarding to a larger group
of employees. This account can be used for read-only access to some of the code repositories.
