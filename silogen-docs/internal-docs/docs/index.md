This documentation concerns systems that are protected from outside use by authentication and authorization.
For most of them a GitHub account is required but some systems may require other means of access permissions.
In each case we will note the credentials needed.

## Other documentation resources

- [SiloGen external documentation](https://docs.silogen.ai)
- Developer documentation. Most of the developer documentation is kept in README files in the repositories.
