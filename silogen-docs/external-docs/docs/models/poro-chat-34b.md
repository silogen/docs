# Poro-chat-34b

Poro-chat model is the chat-tuned version of Poro base model that is capable of handling user dialogues (chat use cases). The model should be prompted (instructed) through the user prompt and not through the system prompt. This is due to the training data where instructions have been placed within the user prompt.
