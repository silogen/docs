# SiloGen Docs Introduction

This is the starting point of the public documentation for the SiloGen product.

This site includes documentation for the chat user interface, AI Developer Center and related APIs. There is manually curated information like this page but also automatically generated information like the API specifications.

## About the SiloGen Platform

SiloGen platform offers API access to a selection of open source and proprietary large language models (LLMs). The LLM generation can be restricted to the content of a document collection with retrieval augmented generation (RAG). This allows the LLM to answer user queries based on an external knowledge base instead of just the LLMâ€™s internal knowledge.

The best results are achieved out-of-the-box with factual questions where the answer exists in the document collection. For many use cases, e.g. handling specialised/technical terminology, it is often necessary to further fine-tune a model and/or design few-shot prompts to get good enough results. Discuss with your SiloGen contact how to achieve the best results for your use case.

SiloGen does not offer a general intelligence solution. Asking the system to draw conclusions about implications beyond the content of the document collection, e.g. environmental impact, impact on political stability or consequences in the future, can generate something that may sound like a reasonable answer but is most often just nonsense.
