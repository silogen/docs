# Datasets

SiloGen allows your to create and manage datasets in the platform for Fine-tuning purposes. Datasets are a collection of data points, where each datapoint represents a conversation, with or without the models' expected response, depending on the use-case.

## Uploading the dataset

Navigate to the **AI Developer Center** â†’ `Datasets` to upload the dataset.
You can provide a name and description for the dataset, and upload a file representing the dataset in JSONL format.
The type of dataset should be selected when uploading the file, and the format of each row should correspond to the type of dataset selected.
