# Pipelines

Pipelines allow you combine a model, a collection and a corresponding set of parameters and prompts as a single unit that your can deliver to your users and integrate into your applications.
Any accessible model, base or fine-tuned, can be used as the basis of your pipelines.

## Creating a pipeline

Navigate to the [Pipelines page](https://chat.services.silogen.ai/console/pipelines) of the developer console to create a new pipeline and click the "Create New" button.

You must provide a unique name for the pipeline and the model to use for the pipeline, and can optionally provide a description.

Click the "Open Settings" button to configure the prompts and settings you would like to associate with the pipeline.
You can optionally also elect to load settings that you last experimented with in the Chat page, by clicking the "Load latest Settings" button at the bottom of the settings panel.

Once you have configured the settings for the pipeline, click the "Back" button to navigate back to the pipeline creation page and click the "Create" button to create the pipeline.

## Deploying a pipeline

Similar to deploying a pipeline, you can navigate to the "Not Deployed" tab of the pipelines page, identify the pipeline you would like to deploy and click the "Deploy" button.
This will deploy the pipeline, and if the corresponding model, if it was not previously deployed.

### Accessing a deployed pipeline

Once a pipeline has been deployed, you can navigate to the [Chat page](https://chat.services.silogen.ai/console/chat), select the base model of the pipeline and subsequently select the pipeline from the dropdown to converse with the pipeline.
The settings for the pipeline are automatically loaded in, and you can optionally choose to experiment with the settings further.

You can also access the pipeline by selecting the "View Code" menu item corresponding to the deployed pipeline and using the code snippet for inferencing via the API.

## Editing a pipeline

You can edit a pipeline, deployed or not, by clicking the "Edit" menu item corresponding to the pipeline.pipeline

If the pipeline you are editing has been deployed, the new version of the pipeline will automatically be deployed once the changes are saved.
