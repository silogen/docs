# Overview
SiloGen platform provides AI resource management features through a module called Airman. Its key capabilities lie in cluster management and maintaining teams' access to computational resources.

## Airman features
Airman is built around the basic usage pattern of maintaining compute resources, setting up teams and projects, adding quotas, and individual users using the resources for their compute needs.

- **Cluster**: This is the physical part of the platform installation which can be managed in the Airman user interface.
- **Organization**: Organization is built from teams. Each team can have multiple users and multiple quotas.
- **Quota**: Quota is a usage limit reserved for a team to accomplish their tasks. Quotas are useful for ensuring everyone gets their fair share of compute resourses.
- **User**: Users are individuals who require compute access for work purposes.
