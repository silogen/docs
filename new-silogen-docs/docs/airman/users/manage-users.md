# Manage users

Users enter SiloGen platform with their email address that has been granted access. User management happens in Access control section found in the navigation.

## Main view

The main view of user management lists users with all relevant information related to them. Mainly the user's name and their email address inform who the user is and the role tells about their capabilities in the platform. Above the list is a search field capable of searching from name and address fields. Below the user list is a pagination used for navigating the user list.

## User view

When clicking the user's name in the list, the view switches to the user view. It displays a form for updating user's name. The users' email address cannot be changed in the platform. Click "Save changes" button to accept the update.

Below the form is an area called Danger zone. It contains a button for deleting the user account. Deleting an account is a permanent action, and shouldn't be done without proper consideration.

The right pane lists users assignments to different user groups and their dedicated user role. User with proper user role can adjust individual users' user groups or change their role.
