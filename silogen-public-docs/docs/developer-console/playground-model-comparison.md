# Playground - Model Comparison

The Playground allows you to compare output of different models, as well as test how different settings, including how changes to system and (RAG) prompt templates affect the output.

_Figure 4. SiloGen developer console. For now, you can compare different model behaviours, and test how different retrieval and generation parameters affect the LLM answer. The prompt and retrieved chunks can be inspected via the “bug” icon that appears if you hover the mouse on the assistant reply (see LLM answer in left column). You can also test different retrieval and generation prompts using same format as for the API [Changing Prompt Template for RAG](../using-the-api/llm-service/changing-prompt-template.md)_
